I don'tt let myself start a book that I'm not going to finish you know when you're reading you have to be careful that you really are concentrating particularly if it's a nonfiction book are you taking the new knowledge and sort of attaching to know that you have and for me taking notes helps make sure that I'm really thinking hard about about what's in there if I disagree with the book sometimes it takes a long time to read the book because I'm crying so much it's actually kind of frustrating oh please say something I agree with so I can get through to the end of this book so there's this one it's a fiction book called infinite I'm trying to decide if I want to watch the movie the end of the tour I loved it David Foster Wallace comes across as a super interesting broad thinking person if the book was like two or three hundred page book there's no doubt as soon as I watched that movie I dive in but it's quite long and complicated and you know I don't want to make an exception it's my rule to get to the end over time I will make the switch but when I'm just sitting there at night reading often a paper magazine of the the book I'm used to that and it's ridiculous because I have a whole book bag that goes on my trips with me and it's it's voluminous and Antiquated books like these you'd want to be sitting down for an hour at a time because otherwise just getting your mind around okay it's not the kind of thing you can do five minutes here 10 minutes there may go see articles fit or short YouTube videos that into those little slots and so you know every night I'm reading a little over an hour and so I can take my current book and make some progress
